# JustSnap-Analyst-Assignment

Project Overview

This project implements a product matching system that:

Takes unstructured product descriptions as input.

Extracts structured attributes such as size, color, brand, material, season, and year.

Finds the top matching SKUs from the product catalog.

Provides confidence scores and alternative matches.

The system aims to reduce manual matching time, improve inventory tracking, and increase sales by automatically suggesting the most relevant products.
